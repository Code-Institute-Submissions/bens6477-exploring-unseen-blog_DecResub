## Planning

### Agile Approach
This project was implemented using an Agile approach to take advantage of the iterative and incremental development.

A key advantage of this approach was the iterative and incremental development, which created a highly adaptable and efficient work schedule. Tasks were completed in stages to fulfil user stories, which incrementally improved the functionality of the website. The project was split into two-day iterations, to review progress and adjust the work schedule accordingly.

Jira was used to organise the project tasks and timeline. A kanban board was used to move user stories across To Do, In Progress and Done columns according to their status.

The project board can be viewed [here](https://bens6477.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/EUB/boards/1).

Epics were refined into User Stories and further split into specific Tasks to complete.


## Notes
The first commit with django integration pushed a secret key to GitHub, however this was resolved immediately in the next commit using the env.py file. This contained sensitive data not to be publicly accessible on GitHub and was withheld using the .gitignore file.

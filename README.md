## Planning

### Target Audience
* Users who wish to explore new places and attractions.
* Users who are looking to engage in an interactive community of travelers.
* Users who are looking share their traveling highlights favourite places.

### Agile Approach
This project was implemented using an Agile approach to take advantage of the iterative and incremental development.

A key advantage of this approach was the iterative and incremental development, which created a highly adaptable and efficient work schedule. Tasks were completed in stages to fulfil user stories, which incrementally improved the functionality of the website. The project was split into two-day iterations, to review progress and adjust the work schedule accordingly.

GitHub Projects was used to organise the project tasks and timeline. A kanban board was used to move user stories across To Do, In Progress and Done columns according to their status.

### Data Model
* This project used Object Oriented programming, utilising model classes to define data.
* PostgreSQL was used to create a relational database of objects
* Four classes were defined: User, Country, Article and Comment
* Data fields were defined for each parameter
* Foreign key fields were used to reference objects in different tables

![Database model](readme_images/database_model.png)


## Features
* Filter articles by country
* Upvote / Downvote articles
* Leave a comment
* Register an account
* Sign In
* Sign Out


## User Permissions
* Only the article author or superusers (admins) can edit / delete each article. Achieved through <code>{% if user == article.author or user.is_superuser %}</code>
* Only superusers can edit / delete countries. Since other articles rely on countries and deleting countries cascade deletes articles, this functionality is restricted to admins only.
* Any authenticated user can add a new country and add a new article, as creating new data does not affect current data in the database.


## Future Enhancements
Various additional features would bring a greater user experience to the website:
* 


## Technology Used
* HTML - Creating and adding content
* CSS - Styling content
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Manipulating DOM content
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Backend code for writing classes methods and functions.
* [Django]() - Full stack framework with convenient shortcuts for effective website backend. Allauth and Coverage extensions were also used for users authentication and testing code coverage respectively.
* [Postgres ]() - Database integrated with Heroku
* [Summernote]() - Inserting styled content
* [Cloudinary ]() - Permanent location for storing images on the cloud 
* [Bootstrap]() - Website structure and styling
* [jQuery]() - Interactivity through bootsrtap scripts
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) - Site deployment
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/) - Arrow icons
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - IDE for local development
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - to host the repositories for this project and the live website preview


## Testing
### Automated Testing
Django's built in TestCast library was used to test python functionality.
* test_forms.py - Forms were tested to verify that the correct fields were added and also checked for required fields.
* test_models.py - Models were tested to check the correct fields were added to models and that default values were correct.
* test_views.py - Views were tested to check the correct templates were returned and that client responses were successful.

Automated tests were ran using the following command: <code>python3 manage.py test</code>

### Functionality Testing

* **Test üß™** - Testing the final code in multiple terminals.
    * **Result üèÜ** - All operations were working successfully in both GitPod and the deployed Heroku terminal.
    * **Verdict ‚úÖ** - This test passed, frequent assessment of the compatibility of code in both terminals ensured a pass was maintained.

* **Test üß™** - Testing deployed site across multiple browsers.
    * **Result üèÜ** - The deployed Heroku site was successfully tested using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge to verify full functionality of the game.
    * **Verdict ‚úÖ** - This test passed as, the site functioned successfully across all browsers.


### Validator Testing
* HTML
    * No unexpected errors were returned when running the HTML code through the [official W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
    * The only errors that were returned were due to the django framework integrated into the HTML code.
    * For example, <code>article_detail.html</code> extends <code>base.html</code> and therefore did not need DOCTYPE, html, head, meta, or body tags as these are defined in the base template.
    * Additionally, the {} syntax was not recognised as valid agruments and therefore returned as bad values, where in production they provided the correct values.
* CSS
    * No errors were found when running the CSS code through the [official W3C Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* JavaScript
    * No errors were found when running the JavaScript code through the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/).
* Python
    * No unexpected errors were returned when running the Python code through the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#).
    * In <code>blog/views.py</code> and <code>blog/test_views.py</code>, there were several warning stating that variables were <code>assigned to but never used</code>. However, these variables were used and referenced by the Django framework and the functions would fail in the absence of these variables. 
* Accessibility
    * A high level of accessibility was returned when Lighthouse was ran in Google Chrome developer tools

### Bugs
* **Problem üêû** - The first commit with django integration pushed a secret key to GitHub in the public domain
    * **Resolution ‚úÖ** - This was resolved immediately in the next commit using the env.py file. This contained sensitive data not to be publicly accessible on GitHub and was withheld using the .gitignore file.

### Bugs
* **Problem üêû** - When running automated tests models could not be accessed.
    * **Resolution ‚úÖ** - Added an if statement to check if "test" was included in the cli command. If so, access the sqlite3 database, and if not access the dj_database_url database.

```
if 'test' in sys.argv:
    #Configuration for test database
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
  #Default configuration
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }"
```

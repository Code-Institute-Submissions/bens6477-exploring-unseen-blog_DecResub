## Planning

### Agile Approach
This project was implemented using an Agile approach to take advantage of the iterative and incremental development.

A key advantage of this approach was the iterative and incremental development, which created a highly adaptable and efficient work schedule. Tasks were completed in stages to fulfil user stories, which incrementally improved the functionality of the website. The project was split into two-day iterations, to review progress and adjust the work schedule accordingly.

Jira was used to organise the project tasks and timeline. A kanban board was used to move user stories across To Do, In Progress and Done columns according to their status.

The project board can be viewed [here](https://bens6477.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/EUB/boards/1).

Epics were refined into User Stories and further split into specific Tasks to complete.
